		<h2>About</h2>

		<p>
			Phy project is a basic language to simplify creation and control of physics engine on three.js project. Phy make bridge from three to physics in worker or directly. This is the compilation of all my physics work in javascript.
		</p>

		<p>
			Phy provide same command on physics engine.
			Each engine have is own feature.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				OIMO is light, stable and speed for simple project.

			</li>
			<li>
				AMMO is wasm port of Bullet engine, is powefull and have soft body. Use for complex simulation.
				[link:https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js built by Kripken]
			</li>
			<li>
				PHYSX is wasm port of Nvidia Physx engine, is the most recent and powerful.It's the fastest and have very stable joint for robotics.

		<p>
			Rapier and Cannon are also in test...
		</p>

		<h2>Feature</h2>

		<p>
			Phy build provide loader, controler, environment, real character, particle engine, terrain editor, advanced geometry, instance geometry.
		</p>

		<h2>About</h2>

		<p>
			Phy is under active development. You can help me improve phy engine by making donation.<br><br>
			Each physics engine need he own build is all pack in /build folder.
